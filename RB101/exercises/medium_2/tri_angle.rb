# A triangle is classified as follows:

# right One angle of the triangle is a right angle (90 degrees)
# acute All 3 angles of the triangle are less than 90 degrees
# obtuse One angle is greater than 90 degrees.
# To be a valid triangle, the sum of the angles must be exactly 180 degrees, and all angles must be greater than 0: if either of these conditions is not satisfied, the triangle is invalid.

# Write a method that takes the 3 angles of a triangle as arguments, and returns a symbol :right, :acute, :obtuse, or :invalid depending on whether the triangle is a right, acute, obtuse, or invalid triangle.

# You may assume integer valued angles so you don't have to worry about floating point errors. You may also assume that the arguments are specified in degrees.

=begin
input: 3 integers
output: symbol
-right angle includes 90deg
-acute angle all numbers less than 90deg
-obtuse angle includes one angle greater than 90deg
-Valid_tri?
  all 3 numbers added equales 180
  all numbers are greater than 0
- no floats

Data Struct
Array, integers, symbols

Algorithm
Create array with each index the passed in degs
Check if the triangle is valid 
  if not return :invalid
Check if one of the numbers is equal to 90
  if so return :right
Count how many numbers are less than 90
  if more than 1 return :acute
  else return obtuse
