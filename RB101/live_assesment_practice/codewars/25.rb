Pete likes to bake some cakes. He has some recipes and ingredients. Unfortunately he is not good in maths. 
Can you help him to find out, how many cakes he could bake considering his recipes?

Write a function cakes(), which takes the recipe (object) and the available ingredients (also an object) 
and returns the maximum number of cakes Pete can bake (integer). For simplicity there are no units for the amounts 
(e.g. 1 lb of flour or 200 g of sugar are simply 1 or 200). Ingredients that are not present in the objects, can be considered as 0.

Examples:

// must return 2
cakes({flour: 500, sugar: 200, eggs: 1}, {flour: 1200, sugar: 1200, eggs: 5, milk: 200}); 
// must return 0
cakes({apples: 3, flour: 300, sugar: 150, milk: 100, oil: 100}, {sugar: 500, flour: 2000, milk: 2000}); 
=end

def cakes(recipe, ingre)
  recipe.map do |key, value|
    if ingre[key].nil?
      return 0
    else
      ingre[key] / value
    end
  end.min
end

p cakes({"flour"=>500, "sugar"=>200, "eggs"=>1},{"flour"=>1200, "sugar"=>1200, "eggs"=>5, "milk"=>200}) == 2
p cakes({"cream"=>200, "flour"=>300, "sugar"=>150, "milk"=>100, "oil"=>100},{"sugar"=>1700, "flour"=>20000, "milk"=>20000, "oil"=>30000, "cream"=>5000}) == 11
p cakes({"apples"=>3, "flour"=>300, "sugar"=>150, "milk"=>100, "oil"=>100},{"sugar"=>500, "flour"=>2000, "milk"=>2000}) == 0
p cakes({"apples"=>3, "flour"=>300, "sugar"=>150, "milk"=>100, "oil"=>100},{"sugar"=>500, "flour"=>2000, "milk"=>2000, "apples"=>15, "oil"=>20}) == 0
p cakes({"eggs"=>4, "flour"=>400},{}) == 0
p cakes({"cream"=>1, "flour"=>3, "sugar"=>1, "milk"=>1, "oil"=>1, "eggs"=>1},{"sugar"=>1, "eggs"=>1, "flour"=>3, "cream"=>1, "oil"=>1, "milk"=>1}) == 1


=begin
input: 2 hashes
output: integer
- How many recipes can you make with the ingrediants
- hash1 is the recipe
- hash2 are the ingrediants

Algorithm
- Create a method cakes that takes recipe and ingre
  - loop and transform the recipe |key, value|
    - Find the key in ingre (if it is nil return 0)
    - divide the ingre by the recipe (return this number to the map)
  - return the lowest number from recipe
